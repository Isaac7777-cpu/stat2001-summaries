# Some Theorems Regarding the Normal Distribution

::: {#thm-sample-mean-of-normal-rv}

Suppose that $Y_1, Y_2, \ldots, Y_n \sim^{\text{iid}} N(\mu, \sigma^2)$. Let $$\bar{Y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n y_i \hspace{20pt} \text{(the sample mean)}$$. Then $$\bar{Y} \sim N(\mu , \frac{\sigma^2}{n})$$

:::

::: {.proof}

In [Chapter 6](../chapter-06/index.qmd), we showed that linear combinations of normal rv's are also normal. So it only remains to find the mean and variance of $\bar{Y}$.

$$
\begin{align}
E[\bar{Y}] & = E\left[\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n Y_i\right] \\
& = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n \mu = \frac{1}{n}n\mu = \mu
Var(\bar{Y}) &= \frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{i=1}^n Var(Y_i) \\
&= \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i = 1}^n \sigma^2 \\ 
& = \frac{1}{n^2}n\sigma^2 = \frac{\sigma^2}{n} \\
\end{align}

# Sampling Distribution

## Standardised Sample Mean

$$
Z = \frac{\bar{Y} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \sim N(0, 1)
$$

:::

$Z$ may be called the _standardised sample mean_. The sample mean $\bar{Y}$ is an example of a _statistic_

::: {#def-statistic}

## Statistic

A _statistic_ is any function of the observable random variables in a sample and known constants.

:::

The probability distribution of a statistic is sometimes referred to as the _sampling distribution_ of that statistic. For example, $\bar{Y} - \mu$ is nto a statistic unless $\mu$ is known. Similarly, $Z$ in @cor-standardised-normal-rv is not a statistic unless both $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are known.

::: {#exm-1}

A bottling machine discharges volumes of drink that are independent and normally distributed with standard deviation 1 ml.  
Find the sampling distribution of the mean volume of 9 randomly selected bottles that are filled by the machine.  
Hence find the probability that this sample mean will be within 0.3 ml of the mean volume of all bottles filled by the machine.

---

Let $Y_i$ be the volume of the $i$ th bottle in the sample, $i = 1, \ldots, n$ where $n = 9$. Then $Y_1, Y_2, \ldots , Y_n \sim^{\text{iid}} N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, where $\sigma^2 = 1$ and $\mu$ is unknown. So $\bar{Y} \sim N(\mu, 1/9)$. Hence

$$
\begin{align}
P(\lvert \bar{Y} - \mu \rvert < 0.3) & = P(\left\lvert \frac{\bar{Y} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \right\rvert < \frac{0.3}{1/3}) = P(\lvert Z \rvert < 0.9) \\
& = 1 - 2P(Z > 0.9) = 0.6318
\end{align}
$$

It is important to note that we do not need any knowledge of $\mu$. In fact, this is an example of a pivotal statistics.

Suppose that $Y_1, Y_2, \ldots , Y_n \sim^{\text{iid}} N(\mu, \sigma^2)$. Let
$$
S^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i = 1}^n (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2
$$
