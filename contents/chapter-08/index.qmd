This chapter is about estimation of the distribution parameters in general. There are four main aspects that we are going to cover here.

1. Point Estimation
2. Evaluation Statistics for a Point Estimation
3. Interval Estimation
4. Monte-Carlo Method

Overall, this is almost the peak of this course as everything we have learnt and will learn is built around this topic.
