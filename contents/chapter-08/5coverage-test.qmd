## ‚úÖ What is Coverage Probability?

The coverage probability of a confidence interval method is:

The probability that the interval contains the true parameter value, over repeated samples.

For a $95%$ confidence interval for a proportion $p$, this means:

$$
\text{Coverage at } p = \mathbb{P}_p\left( \text{CI contains } p \right)
$$

It answers: ‚ÄúIf the true proportion is p, how often does the method capture it?‚Äù

## üéØ How Coverage is Computed (for Binomial CI)

We assume:

-	$Y \sim \text{Binomial}(n, p)$
-	Each possible outcome $y = 0, 1, \dots, n$ has probability $\binom{n}{y} p^y (1 - p)^{n - y}$

We calculate coverage for each $p$ as:

$$
\text{Coverage}(p) = \sum_{y=0}^{n} \mathbb{P}(Y = y) \cdot \mathbf{1}\left[ p \in \text{CI}(y) \right]
$$

Where:

-	$\mathbf{1}[p \in \text{CI}(y)] = 1$ if the interval contains $p$, otherwise $0$
-	$\text{CI}(y)$ is the confidence interval computed from $y$

## In Code Terms

For each value of $p$ in the grid:

1.	Loop through all $y = 0, 1, \ldots, n$
2.	For each $y$:
	-	Compute $\text{CI}(y)$ using the chosen method (Wald, Wilson, etc.)
	-	Check if $p \in \text{CI}(y)$
	-	Weight that check by the binomial probability $P(Y = y)$
	3.	Sum those weighted checks ‚Üí coverage probability at that $p$

## Example (manually, say n = 3, p = 0.2)

Let‚Äôs say:
-	You compute CIs for each $y \in \{0, 1, 2, 3\}$
-	You get:
-	CI(0): $[0.00, 0.40]$
-	CI(1): $[0.05, 0.60]$
-	CI(2): $[0.30, 0.85]$
-	CI(3): $[0.60, 1.00]$

Then check:

-	Is 0.2 in CI(0)? ‚úÖ
-	Is 0.2 in CI(1)? ‚úÖ
-	Is 0.2 in CI(2)? ‚ùå
-	Is 0.2 in CI(3)? ‚ùå

Get binomial probabilities:

-	$P(Y = 0) = (1 - 0.2)^3 = 0.512$
-	$P(Y = 1) = 3 \cdot 0.2 \cdot (0.8)^2 = 0.3844$
-	$P(Y = 2) = 0.096$
-	$P(Y = 3) = 0.008$

Then:
$$
\text{Coverage at } p = 0.2 = 0.512 + 0.384 = 0.896
$$

‚úÖ Why This Is Accurate

This is effectively a theoretical simulation: you compute the expected proportion of times the CI captures the true p using the binomial model ‚Äî without sampling.

It reflects exact coverage (not approximate), assuming:

-	The distribution of data is exactly binomial
-	The CI method is applied correctly for every possible $y$
